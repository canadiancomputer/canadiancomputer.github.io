<h1>Rental Process</h1><br>
<a href="#return-process">Skip to Return Process</a>
<p>Setting up a rental requires two documents. A Rental Allocation Order and a Rental Fee Order. The Rental Allocation Order is used to reserve the product being rented, and communicate the value of the items being rented to the customer. The Rental Fee Order is invoiced to charge the customer for the rental. Below are instructions for setting up both documents.</p>
<p>To determine the Rental Rate, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WuqAkQ_-M2cmvTDFYXx1lamh-8uxPsnXuaMALwK9c2k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the calculator here</a></p>
<p>Rentals during repairs will be offered to customers for <b>$99 for the duration of the repair.</b> The rest of the process remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>To set up a Rental Allocation Order, do the following:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Create a new Order, and assign "Carbon/Core 1 Rental Order" as the customer on this order.</li>
	<li>Add any physical products being rented to the customer, ensuring each is accurately listed.</li>
	<li>Add a hyphen and the customer's name after the Carbon/Core 1 Rental Order name. (e.g. Carbon Computing Rental Order - Nathan Arfin)</li>
	<li>Put the duration into the "PO" field</li>
	<li>Reserve inventory on this order</li>
	<li>Add any special instructions for internal use into the internal notes of this order.</li>
</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Customer Name</li>
			<li>Allocation Order Number</li>
			<li>Sales Rep Initials</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take a Pre-Authorization, Capture Customer ID, and Complete Rental Agreement</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Perform a Pre-Authorization transaction for the value of the rented equipment</li>
		<li>Record Credit Card details and Pre-Authorization Code in the internal notes of the Rental Fee Order</li>
		<li>Take a scan of Government Issued Photo ID - Name the File the Order ID</li>
		<li>Fill out and get customer signature on the Rental Agreement Form - <a href="CC-Rental.pdf">(Carbon)</a> <a href="C1-Rental.pdf">(Core 1)</a></li>

<h3>Final Steps</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Link the two orders together - <img src="gear.png" height="20px;"> Gearbox - Link This Document</li>
	<li>Take all completed paperwork to the Inventory manager for approval and review</li>
</ul>
<h3>A note about accessories</h3>
<p>Inventory will remove all manuals and software from the product, as well as common small accessories, or additional packaging by default. These are removed in order to make sure that they are available to re-pack with the product when it is returned. Often these items get lost, and are not required for the rental unit to operate. If you require one of these accessories for the rental, you should be sure to include special instructions in the internal notes of your allocation order.</p>
<h3>A note about Rental selection</h3>
<p>For Rental units, always pick a Rental Unit (RN Suffix), Used, or open box product (OP Suffix). Do not use any new, factory sealed product for rentals. If the unit being rented is to replace a client's machine which is in service for repair, please ensure that the unit being rented is of equal or lower specifications (and value) than what the customer has left in service for repair. Best efforts will be made to come as close as possible to the unit being checked in.</p>
